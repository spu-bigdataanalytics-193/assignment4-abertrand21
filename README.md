## Assignment 4 ##

In this assignment we are still working with the same data file than with the previous assignment but this time we are using Spark.
I decided to do my assignment using GoogleColab. The first step was to use the script that was provided to us so that we could use Spark on Colab.

The data comes from the Drive and then we use the Map Reduce alogithm again to have the number of flights by carrier.
